		<h2>JOE Developer Guide</h2>
		<hr>
		The developer guide which existed here in previous releases was so horribly out of date that it was really more hazzard than help. Therefore, I've removed it. If you have questions about doing development on or with JOE please post them to the discussion forums at: <a href="http://sourceforge.net/forum/?group_id=14510">http://sourceforge.net/forum/?group_id=14510</a>.
