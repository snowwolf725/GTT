		<h2>JOE User Guide</h2>
		<hr>
		The user guide which existed here in previous releases was so horribly out of date that it was really more hazzard than help. Therefore, I've removed it. If you have questions about how to use JOE please post them to the discussion forums at: <a href="http://sourceforge.net/forum/?group_id=14510">http://sourceforge.net/forum/?group_id=14510</a>.
